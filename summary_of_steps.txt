## BASIC STEPS:
1. data preprocessing : 
- different types & sizes of microscopy images observed from EDA 
- issues with size scaling & intensity variations 

- use of scaling/ splitting images, contrast-enhanced images with histogram equalization, conversion to grayscale


2. data augmentation: flipping, random rotation & cropping


3. build the CNN / U-net model & run on training data

"fit the model on the training data, using a validation split of 0.1. We use a small batch size because we have so little data. 
I recommend using checkpointing and early stopping when training your model. I won't do it here to make things a bit more 
reproducible (although it's very likely that your results will be different anyway). I'll just train for 10 epochs, 
which takes around 10 minutes in the Kaggle kernel with the current parameters."


4. check predictions on some random images in the training & validation set

5. make predictions on test set
"need to keep a record of the original sizes of the test images to upsample our predicted masks and create correct 
run-length encodings later on"

6. clean up the images before submission (remove single pixels, connect nearby regions) ?

7. encode to RLE & submit  (do we need to check the RLEs for the training data?)
