?EDA:  main theme: presence of multiple types of images (image modality) & image sizes (some types in the test set 
   do not have similar types in training set;  also, there are issues upon scaling the images)

https://www.kaggle.com/mpware/stage1-eda-microscope-image-types-clustering
https://www.kaggle.com/jackvial/exploratory-data-analysis-dsb-2018    <- scaling issues; some images have few masks, others have many
 "There is a large range of image dimensions in the dataset and not all of the images are square. 
 The smallest image was 256x256 and the largest was 1040x1388 pixels. The smallest nucleus was only a few pixels in size 
 and was found in one of the larger images (1000x1000), resizing this image caused the tiny nucleus to disappear 
 so resizing images should be approached with great caution. The size of nuclei vary a lot throughout the images 
 in the training set and is likely to make detection more challenging."

? SUBMISSION PROCESS :
https://www.kaggle.com/stkbailey/teaching-notebook-for-total-imaging-newbies/notebook  <- see section "Convert 
  each labeled object to Run Line Encoding - Finally, we need to encode each label_mask into a "run line encoded" string. 
  Basically, we walk through the array, and when we find a pixel that is part of the mask, we index it and count 
  how many subsequent pixels are also part of the mask. We repeat this each time we see new pixel start point."
